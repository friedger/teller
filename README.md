# Teller

Teller is a sophisticated Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to facilitate developers' interactions with STX contracts. It streamlines the process of exploring source code and leveraging various analytics tools, thereby significantly enhancing the developer experience within the STX ecosystem. With its intuitive design, Teller ensures that integrating STX contracts into projects is both straightforward and efficient.

## Installing

Homebrew is the recommended way to install Teller:

```sh
brew install hashhavoc/tap/teller
```

## Configuration

There is a configuration file that contains various configuration values. You can find an example at `config/config.yaml.example`.

```sh
teller init
```

This will create a new configuration file at `~/.teller.yaml` with the default values. You can then edit this file to your liking. There is not currently a way to specify the configuration file location. Not all of the endpoints are avaliable publicly, so you may need to specify your own endpoints.
